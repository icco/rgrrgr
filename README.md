A study of schedulers.

## Overview

We are looking to research how a truly fair scheduler may effect a interactive system. We plan on 
doing research to figure out some of the previous work done in this area and then implement a 
scheduler which we believe is truly fair. We hope to improve the responsiveness of interactive 
applications and performance of multimedia applications, possibly at the cost of sacrificing 
performance in batch and server applications.
