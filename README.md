A study of schedulers.

## Overview

We are looking to research how a truly fair scheduler may effect a interactive system. We plan on doing research to figure out some of the previous work done in this area and then implement a scheduler which we believe is truly fair. We are hoping that by having a truly fair scheduler we will promote system stability and responsiveness.
